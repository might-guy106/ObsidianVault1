- Using mobile as a compute machine that always run
- we have to think about how to run server first (which may require rooting the phone, i dont know what it is)
- then we should solve the charging problem, how to make it run all the time, hardware tinkering is needed i guess. if not it should always be plugged to a slow charger

but i think its great what do you say about it ?
