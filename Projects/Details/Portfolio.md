- took domain name from spaceship
- want to build portfolio + blog so ssg is best option so hosting is done by github pages
- used astro which is good for ssg and astropaper for template
- configured github workflow and custom domain settings for the repo and domain dns to map vpankaj.com to mightguy106.github.io
